# Porfolio-Optimisation

This project explored the concept of portfolio optimisation using the Python programming language. We focused on constructing two distinct portfolios: an equal-weighted portfolio and an optimized portfolio.

The equal-weighted portfolio was created by distributing an equal allocation of $10,000 across four carefully selected stocks. We calculated the cumulative return, mean daily return, standard deviation daily return, Sharpe ratio, and annualized Sharpe ratio for this portfolio.

To optimise the portfolio, we generated 10,000 different scenarios by randomly generating weightings for each stock. We then calculated the return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio for each scenario. The optimal portfolio was identified as the one with the highest Sharpe ratio.

We visualized the portfolio scenarios on a scatter plot, showcasing the relationship between volatility and return. The optimal portfolio was identified as the one with the highest Sharpe ratio and was visualized on the scatter plot.

Overall, this project provided a hands-on experience in portfolio optimization, allowing us to explore different strategies and techniques to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
